# Problem Decision Tool - as seen at Micr0soft Federal BizApps Summit

As Featured at the Microsoft Federal BizApps Summit
The Problem Decision Tool streamlines how organizations classify and prioritize continuous improvement initiatives. Through a simple, guided question interface, users are directed to the most appropriate improvement pathway — whether that be a Rapid Process Improvement Workshop (RPIW), or a Lean Yellow Belt, Green Belt, or Black Belt project.

This tool, built in Power Apps, ensures that the scope and complexity of a problem are matched with the right resources and methodologies, empowering data-driven decision-making while driving efficiency and Lean process improvements across service lines.

🧩 Custom HTML in Power Apps — Linking to Resources
The tool leverages the HTML Text control to dynamically present custom guidance and clickable links to:

🔗 Websites (e.g., yoursite.org, SharePoint)
📄 Documents (e.g., templates or resource folders)
👨‍💼 Email contacts (mailto: links)
📊 Power BI Reports
🔗 Basic HTML Link Syntax

<a href="URL_HERE" target="_blank">Link Text Here</a>
href: Destination (URL, document, email)
target="_blank": Opens in a new tab/window
Link Text Here: Clickable link label
💻 Examples of Links Used in the Tool:
1️⃣ Link to a Website:

<a href="https://www.va.gov" target="_blank">Visit VA Website</a>
2️⃣ Link to a SharePoint Document:

<a href="https://yourorg.sharepoint.com/sites/Docs/Shared%20Documents/Example.pdf" target="_blank">View PDF Document</a>
3️⃣ Email a Person:

<a href="mailto:john.doe@va.gov">Email John Doe</a>
🧠 Power Fx – Dynamic HTML with Variables
Power Fx allows dynamic link generation by concatenating values into the HTML string.

Example:
"<a href='https://yourorg.sharepoint.com/sites/Docs/" & FileName.Text & "' target='_blank'>Open Document</a>"
⚙️ Best Practices:
Use variables for large or dynamic HTML blocks:

Set(varHTML, "<a href='https://www.va.gov' target='_blank'>Visit VA</a>")
Then bind the HTML control to varHTML.

Ensure permissions for SharePoint/document links.

Trusted URLs only — HTML Text control doesn’t execute scripts (mitigates XSS risks).

🎯 The Decision Logic in Action (Power Fx Example)
Here’s how HTML links are conditionally embedded based on the project type selected in the tool:

🔍 Sample Power Fx Code:
powerapps


    If(
    varGreenbeltselected = true,
    "This problem requires a Lean A3 Deep Dive. A Green Belt project impacts 2-4 service lines. Completion can award Lean Green Belt certification if facilitated by a trained individual.<br><br>" &
    "Recruit support here: <a href='https://app.powerbigov.us/Redirect?...' target='_blank'>Power BI (powerbigov.us)</a><br><br>" &

    "Start with A3 templates: <a href='https://environment.sharepoint.com/sites/location/Shared%20Documents/...'
    target='_blank'>CNVAMC Systems Redesign - A-3 Documents</a><br><br>" &

    "Contact your Systems Redesign Coordinators for assistance.")
🎨 Optional Styling for Links:

<a href="https://va.gov" style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;" target="_blank">Bold Blue Link</a>
🏁 Summary:
The Problem Decision Tool doesn't just guide users — it empowers action by embedding direct access to relevant tools, contacts, and resources in real-time, all using HTML Text controls in Power Apps and smart Power Fx logic.
