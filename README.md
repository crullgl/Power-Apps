# Power-Apps
Problem Decision tool
The Decision Support Tool streamlines project classification by guiding users through a simple question-based interface to determine whether their initiative requires a Rapid Process Improvement Workshop (RPIW), Yellow Belt, Green Belt, or Black Belt project. Designed to enhance efficiency and reduce ambiguity, the tool ensures that resources and methodologies are aligned with the complexity and scope of each project, supporting data-driven decision-making and continuous improvement efforts across the organization.

In Power Apps, the HTML Text control lets you display custom HTML content. You can embed hyperlinks to:

Websites (e.g., SharePoint sites)
Documents (e.g., PDFs, Word files)
Email addresses (mailto: links)
Internal Power Apps URLs (deep linking)
🔗 Basic HTML Link Syntax
html
Copy
Edit
<a href="URL_HERE" target="_blank">Link Text Here</a>
href: The destination (website, document, or email).
target="_blank": Opens link in a new tab/window.
Link Text Here: What the user sees and clicks.
💻 Example 1 – Link to a Website
html
Copy
Edit
<a href="https://www.va.gov" target="_blank">Visit VA Website</a>
📄 Example 2 – Link to a Document in SharePoint
html
Copy
Edit
<a href="https://yourorg.sharepoint.com/sites/Docs/Shared%20Documents/Example.pdf" target="_blank">
View PDF Document
</a>
⚠️ SharePoint links must be shared with proper permissions.
👨‍💼 Example 3 – Link to Email a Person
html
Copy
Edit
<a href="mailto:john.doe@va.gov">Email John Doe</a>
🧠 Dynamic Data in Links – Using Concatenation
You can use Power Fx to dynamically insert URLs or names.

Example: Link to a document with dynamic file name:

powerapps
Copy
Edit
"<a href='https://yourorg.sharepoint.com/sites/Docs/Shared%20Documents/" & FileName.Text & "' target='_blank'>Open Document</a>"
⚡ Performance Tip:
Avoid embedding large HTML strings directly in the control. Use variables or collections if the content is complex or changes frequently.

Example with a variable:

powerapps
Copy
Edit
Set(varHTML, "<a href='https://www.va.gov' target='_blank'>Visit VA</a>")
Then bind the HTML Text control to varHTML.

🔒 Security Tip:
HTML Text controls do not execute scripts, which helps prevent XSS (cross-site scripting). Still, ensure URL sources are trusted.

🔧 Advanced Styling (Optional)
Customize links with inline styles:

html
Copy
Edit
<a href="https://va.gov" style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;" target="_blank">Bold Blue Link</a>
