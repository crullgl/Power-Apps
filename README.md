<h1>👨‍💻 About Me</h1>

<p><strong>Hi, I’m Gary Crull</strong> — a Power Platform Developer, Program & Management Analyst, and citizen development advocate with a background in both federal service and frontline healthcare. I specialize in building efficient, no-code/low-code apps that transform outdated workflows into agile, scalable solutions.</p>

<p>I’ve led and collaborated on projects that drive real results:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Problem Decision Tool</strong> — Used across federal agencies to triage project needs and determine Lean Belt fit (RPIW, Yellow, Green, Black). Delivered a 23,000% ROI by eliminating unnecessary labor.</li>
  <li><strong>Leader Rounding App</strong> — Streamlined clinical leadership engagement and feedback documentation with mobile-friendly usability.</li>
  <li><strong>Conference Room Scheduler</strong> — Enabled room booking with visual calendars and conflict checking, with automated notifications and approvals.</li>
  <li><strong>HopTel Tracking Tool</strong> — Simplified patient lodging tracking across facilities using galleries, filters, and Power BI integration.</li>
  <li><strong>Morning Report Dashboard</strong> — Rebuilt the daily operations report in Power BI to reduce refresh time from 88 minutes to under 2, increasing adoption and trust in the data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether it's leading microlearning sessions, mentoring analysts, or designing app logic, I’m focused on building tools that work — fast, reliable, and focused on the end user. I believe in the power of visual problem-solving and leveraging data to spark change.</p>

<p><strong>Let’s connect.</strong> If you’re working on workforce modernization, operational excellence, or just trying to fix a broken process, I’d love to collaborate.</p>
