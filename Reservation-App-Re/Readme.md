## üîÅ Recurring Reservation Logic

1. **Enable Recurring Toggle**  
   User selects frequency and number of repeats.

2. **Loop Using `Sequence()`**  
   Generates `[0, 1, 2, ...]` based on how many times the reservation should repeat.

3. **Calculate Dates**  
   - `DateAdd()` and `Switch()` handle different patterns (Daily, Weekly, Bi-Weekly, Monthly).
   - Monthly recurrence uses logic to hit the Nth weekday of the month.

4. **Create Collection**  
   `CollectionRecurrence` stores all StartDateTime/EndDateTime combinations.

5. **Conflict Check**  
   Filters `'Desk Reservations'` to catch any overlap with new entries using `LookUp()`.

6. **Group Records**  
   All entries share a `RecurrenceID`. The first one can be used as the `ParentReservationID` to group or delete later.

## üßÆ ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù Button Logic

When the user clicks **Continue** after selecting date and time:

- Sets variables: `selectedDate`, `selectedEndDate`, `startTime`, and `endTime`.
- Adjusts `endTime` if the end date is earlier than the start.
- Filters existing reservations that overlap the new selection into `colBookedDesks`.
- If any are rooms, it expands to desks linked to that room.
- Navigates to `DeskSelect` screen.
- Builds a filterable collection `colRoomLocations` of all unique rooms with an "All Conference Rms" option.
